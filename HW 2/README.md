I'll be completely honest, I utilized ChatGPT first to give me a better visual example of what I was suppposed to create. I think the wording and how the console is pretty much separate from the index got me all mixed up (that, and I'm sick so my brain is lowkey mush). With that being said, I did create my own, using some of the framework ChatGPT created, such as the console log lists, mainly so I wasn't typing and retyping the same tag 12 times. I will say, the AI one was definitely more polished than mine is, and had more stylizing to it. It gave me answers to the prompts too, and those were typical generic AI answers, so not suprised there. As far as claiming the AI work as my own, I'd say yes, and here's why: when using ChatGPT for any coding, I essentially am describing my own ideas and web structure to it, and if it pushes out something I don't like/won't get right, I'll go in and manually do it myself. At the end of the day, it's still my unique idea, a computer simply transformed my words into code.
