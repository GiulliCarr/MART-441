This was an interesting assignment; it reminded me of a similar project I did for my interactive media class, although for that one I used a scratch based website, and didn't get into the nitty gritty code. The difference of that made this one more tedious, but also interesting to see how detailed it needed to be. I struggled a bit with finding out how to properly set up the code to create more options based on clicking path 1 or 2 at the beginning.

Using ChatGPT to recreate the assignment, it was similar in structure but extremely generic in storyline. It pumped out a scary haunted manor scenario, which seems cool for an AI generated story. ChatGPT's structure helped me in figuring out how to fix some coding errors I had on lines 35-54. I really struggled with that part. I also for the life of me could not figure out how to get the imageIDs to work for the other images I chose for the game. I got it to work for the first one, but after that it was all a mess, so I elected to not use them. Overall, this was a fun assignment, and I can definitely see myself making these into personalized little stories to send to my friends!
