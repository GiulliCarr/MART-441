            <p>Some fun facts about me: I love to create and design mixed media posters (mainly music-inspired), and discover new music as it's a horrible addiction of mine (my Spotify wrap called me out on listening minutes). I love practicing photography, running, and yoga, and I currently work as a graphic design intern with an engineering company & Johnson Space Center. If you're curious about what I do/create in my spare time, take a look at my portfolio <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <p>Answering the question of what is the most pressing issue we face today is honestly daunting considering I'm introducing myself here. But, I think the biggest issue we're facing is a lack of empathy for people outside our communities. As the years have progressed, I feel people are more quick to put themselves first. And that's not inherently bad; but when it jeopardizes those around you and their way of life, it's a blatant disregard for the vast majority. I hope with time, society can heal in this sense, and it becomes more common to be more inviting to all, without prejudice or a hidden agenda.</p>
