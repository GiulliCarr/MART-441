I used Chatgpt to help me format the cases. Essentially,, I had it create the skeleton, and I went in and added the rest. I found it to be quite helpful, as this cut my typing time down by alot, as well as keeping things in a very easy to read format. When I initally created the new body, it was a MESS. I still struggled to figure out the issue with the images not showing up. I even asked AI to analyze the code and tell me where it's going wrong; it told me to create an omages file within my directory. I did that, and nothing changed HAHA; so I kinda accpeted defeat on that part.
